            <h2 class="timeline-heading">here's a timeline of elon musk's life</h2>
            <ul class="timeline-items">
                <li class="timeline-list-item"> he was a transfer student on scholarship (from queens university ontario) at the university of pennsylvania studying physics and economics <strong> ••• he was pursuing two degrees.</strong>  </li>
                <li class="timeline-list-item"> around this time, he started his earliest business venture, which he entered alongside his roommate, a speakeasy. every night, they converted their house to a night club, served alcohol and threw parties <strong> ••• but musk would usually spend his nights away from the club playing “some video game”, according to his roommate. </strong> </li>
                <li class="timeline-list-item">like most people these days, elon didn’t graduate before 22, he didn’t complete his bachelor’s degree until he was 24 <strong>••• there’s no account that says he was was worried about this.</strong></li>
                <li class="timeline-list-item">he had always wanted to become a physicist at a particle accelerator, but this changed when he was 22. why? the biggest particle accelerator project got cancelled in the united states after government funding was pulled out <strong>••• so he decided “fuck that, I’m never getting into what the government can just play around with”.</strong></li>
                <li class="timeline-list-item">before turning 25, musk dropped out of his phd program at stanford (after two days) to join the internet boom and launch his first internet company, zip2, which provided business directories and maps. he started the company with roughly $15k raised by himself and some friends/family. two years later, he would eventually sell the company for $307 million, and use the money to launch his next startup, paypal - which he eventually sold to ebay for $1.5 billion 5 years later <strong>••• his work ethic and business-mindedness is driving me fucking nuts!</strong></li>
            </ul>

        <blockquote class="quote">
            <p>since then, musk has gone on to start spaceX in 2002, followed by tesla motors in 2003. In 2016, he founded neuralink, and a year later, he created the boring company. today, he became the most valuable human on the planet, and his reaction was simply, “how strange. well, back to work.”</p>
